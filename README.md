## What is Triad Secure?
**Triad Secure** is a **file securing application** that combines the elements of the **CIA Triad** and the **current problem domain of device sharing risks by families and friends** to create a **secure** and **user-friendly** security solution for (**Windows, for now**) devices, especially for those that **are used by multiple people**.

## How does Triad Secure Fulfil the CIA Triad in its Implementation?
The features of **Triad Secure** are based on the **CIA Triad**. Those feature includes:
- **Symmetric Encryption** (Confidentiality).
- **Access Control** (Confidentiality).
- **Password-Based Key Derivation Function/PBKDF2** (Confidentiality).
- **Data Masking** (Confidentiality).
- **File's Checksum Hash** (Integrity).
- **File Backup** (Availability).

## Triad Secure's Software Architecture
The **software architecture model** that **Triad Secure** uses is the **Service-Based Architecture Model**, where the application is built from independent software components called "services".

**Triad Secure** has several **architectural characteristics** from the analysed **problem domain** as well as the **functional** and **non-functional requirements**. Those characteristics include:
- **Performance**.
- **Extensibility**.
- **Accessibility**.
- **Security**.
- **Usability**.
- **Privacy**.
- **Feasibility**.

## Acknowledgements
As this is a project for the **Computational Security** and **Software Architecture** courses done with limited time and with a limited personnel, I **acknowledge the shortcomings of the project** and I hope anyone accessing this project will give us the **benefit of the doubt** and are **open** and **highly grateful** to any **suggestion**, **improvements**, or **branches** if the project interested you.

I would also like to give a special thanks to **Mr. Wenripin Chandra, S.Kom., M.TI.** for their **help and assignment** of this project. As well as my gratitude to **friends** and **online queries** that had helped me along the **formulation**, **development**, and **presentation** of **Triad Secure**.

### Hope this project finds you well and prove useful to any problem or as a source of new ideas and inspirations! 🤠
